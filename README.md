# Bachelor's Thesis 

During this time I tried to have fun with ARIMA, GARCH models and LSTMs together with GRUs. 
The data I used were most known stock indecies and the research question itself was quite vague. 

## What did I learn? 

I learned a lot about LSTMs, GRUs and Bayesian Optomisatin that was used for hyper-parameter tuning. 
On the soft-skill level I would like to believe that I learned to recognize hopeless projects. Wether or not I truly learnt this will be discovered in the future. 

This page will not be updated on that (or to be honest on any) matter.

### This repo contains

LSTMs done with Pytorch in Python, ARIMAs done in R, plotting done in R, Bayesian Optimisation done in Python with Ray-->Tune.
